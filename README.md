# Hangman mini-project

![Hangman_picture](http://datagenetics.com/blog/april12012/hangmand.jpg)

## Rules:

- Set a `secret` word for your friends
- Let them play!
- I chose the classic rule where you have `6` attempts.

> [!WARNING]
> The program does NOT remember previous used letters, so if you use multiple times a wrong letter, you will keep loosing hearts, so be careful ðŸ˜‰

**Play with friends**: [Hangman](https://loghindev.github.io/hangman/)

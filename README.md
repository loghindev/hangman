# Hangman mini-project

## Rules:

- Set a `secret` word for your friends
- A word will be generated representing the first value added in `input` field.
- After that, the behavior of `input` will change. You will be able to add only `1` character inside `input` field, which represents the letter you are trying to guess for the generated word.
- I chose the classic rule where you have `6` attempts.
- 🍀 Correct guesses will replace the blank positions in the word with the correct choice.
- ❌ Wrong guesses will substract 1 heart (-1 x ♥️)

> [!WARNING]
> The program does NOT remember previously used letters, so if you use the wrong letter multiple times, you will continue to lose hearts, so be careful 😉
